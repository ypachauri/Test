Jenkins = an open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.
Kafka = Apache Kafka is a Message broker i.e. it helps transmit messages from one system to another - in real time, reliable manner. But that’s not all, Kafka can also work on streams of data and transform them using its stream API

Executor Framework

@RepositoryRestResource 

@Lookup lookup method injection is the process to override a Spring bean at the runtime. Injecting prototype scoped bean in singleton bean.

Java executor framework is used to run the Runnable objects without creating new threads every time and mostly re-using the already created threads
The java.util.concurrent.Executors provide factory methods that are being used to create ThreadPools of worker threads

@EnableAutoConfiguration it automatically creates and registers beans based on both the included jar files in the classpath and the beans defined by us
a way to automatically configure a Spring application based on the dependencies that are present on the classpath

The main advantage of CompletableFuture over normal Future is that CompletableFuture takes advantage of the extremely powerful stream API and gives you callback handlers to chain your tasks, which is absolutely absent if you use normal Future. That along with providing asynchronous architecture, CompletableFuture is the way to go for handling computation heavy map-reduce tasks, without worrying much about application performance.
